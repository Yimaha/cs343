W/OUT -O2
DARRAY:     |   6.23u 1.26s 0:07.50
DSTRING:    |   16.97u 1.27s 0:18.24
DSTRSTREAM: |   6.44u 1.34s 0:07.79

WITH -O2
DARRAY:     |   6.14u 1.28s 0:07.42
DSTRING:    |   12.26u 1.21s 0:13.48
DSTRSTREAM: |   6.26u 1.29s 0:07.55

1b) String Stream and Data Array tends to have a similar level of performance, and it is a lot better when compared to DSTRING.
It is expected, since looking at the code it seems like only the DSTRING implementation keep creating string and merging string, while
in the other 2 approarch, this expensive operation is reduced by quiet a lot, only create once and no merging is done.

1c) It seems like the optimizer was able to improve the performance of DSTRING by quiet a lot, which make sense since there is a
lot of room for improvement, while it has very little effect when it comes to both DARRAY and DSTRSTREAM. Note that DSTRING still 
cannot catch up in performance after the -O2 flag anyway.
