Based off of the protagonist's quote it seems like the condition for the angle to move is:

"unless someone is looking at the angle, angle can move"

that implies the angle have the following logic: // though it is not perfectly coded


uCondLock u[4];
void move(i) {
    while(True) {
        if (someone is looking at me) {
            u[i].wait() // if I found someone is looking at me, i wait until the person looking at me stop looking at me and wake me up
        } 
        dosomething() // kill, move, make scary faces etc
        if (I no longer look at angle j) {
            u[j].signal()
        }
    }
}

in this case, each individual angle is actively waiting for the opposite angle to stop looking at each other.
That is, every one is looking at each other, so u[i] is on wait for all i, but everyone is also waiting for 
another person to call u[j].signal(). This by definition is a deadlock, as the angles are waiting for an 
unlock event that will never happen.
